	The video was recorded with a beta version of React 19 and the behavior you
	see in the video was fixed in the final release of React 19. Feel free to skip
	this step if you'd like. Learn more from [issue #98 on the workshop
	repo](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/react-suspense/issues/98).

üë®‚Äçüíº Right now our `ShipDetails` has to wait for the ship's data before we render
the `ShipImg` component which will then start loading the image. However, we
can start loading the image as soon as we have the ship's name.

Please preload the image for the ship in `ShipDetails` so we don't have that
waterfall.

Pull up the Network tab of your DevTools to and click a ship. You'll notice that
before the image doesn't start loading until the ship's data is loaded and after
the image starts loading as soon as you select a ship.
